List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It ensures the creation of high-quality software that meets user requirements. The main phases of SDLC are:

Requirement Analysis

In this phase, project stakeholders (clients, users, and developers) define the software’s purpose, functionalities, and constraints.
Deliverables: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Planning

The project scope, budget, timeline, and resources are determined.
Risk analysis is conducted to anticipate potential challenges.
Deliverables: Project plan and feasibility study.
System Design

Architects and developers create blueprints for the software’s structure, database, and user interface.
Design can be divided into high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD).
Deliverables: Design documents, data models, and system architecture.
Implementation (Coding & Development)

Developers write code using programming languages based on the design specifications.
The software is built in modules or components and integrated gradually.
Deliverables: Source code and working prototypes.
Testing

The software is tested for bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.
Testing types include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Deliverables: Test cases, bug reports, and test results.
Deployment

The final software product is released to users in a live environment.
Deployment can be done in phases (gradual release) or full deployment (big bang approach).
Deliverables: Deployed software and user manuals.
Maintenance and Support

After deployment, the software requires updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback.
Maintenance includes corrective, adaptive, and preventive maintenance to ensure long-term stability.
Deliverables: Updated versions, security patches, and support logs.
Conclusion
The SDLC provides a systematic approach to software development, ensuring quality, efficiency, and alignment with user needs. Different methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps adapt SDLC phases to suit project requirements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The approch in waterfall methodology is linear and sequential while in agile methodology is iterative and incremental
The flexibility in waterfall methodology is rigid whereas in Agile methodology is higly flexible
Waterfall methodology has minimal involvement after initial planning while that of agile methodology involve frequent customer collaborationand feedback.
  When to use waterfall; 1. in government or military projects
                         2. in healthcare and medical software
                         3.in infrastructureprojects such as banking systems.
    When to use agile;   1. in startups and tech companies 
                        2.on mobile app and web development.

  
Waterfall is best for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, while Agile is ideal for dynamic projects requiring frequent updates and customer collaboration. Many companies now use hybrid models, combining both methodologies for efficiency.
